Microsoft Defender for Office 365 provides the following benefits:

-   **Industry-leading Protection.** Microsoft Defender for Office 365 uses 6.5 trillion signals daily from email alone to quickly and accurately detect threats and protect users against sophisticated attacks such as phishing and zero-day malware. Microsoft Defender for Office 365 blocked 5 billion phish emails and analyzed 300k phish campaigns in 2018 protecting 4 million unique users from advanced threats.
-   **Actionable Insights**. Actionable insights are presented to security administrators by correlating signals from a broad range of data to help identify, prioritize, and provide recommendations on how to address potential problems. The recommendations include remediation actions empowering administrators to proactively secure their organization.
-   **Automated response**. Investigation and remediation in post-breach scenarios can be difficult, expensive, and time-consuming. Most organizations lack the expertise and resources needed for rapid investigation and effective remediation. Microsoft Defender for Office 365 provides advanced automated response options that security operators can leverage saving a significant amount of time, money, and resources.
-   **Training & awareness**. Social engineering attacks such as phishing often look legitimate and are hard to spot for busy users. It's critical to train end users to make the right decisions in the event of an attack. In-product notifications help users understand the risks of performing an action such as clicking on a suspicious link. Features such as attack simulator help administrators launch realistic threat simulations to train users to be more aware and vigilant. User reporting capabilities empower users to notify Microsoft of suspicious content.

The following are the primary ways you can use Microsoft Defender for Office 365 for message protection:

-   In a Microsoft Defender for Office 365 filtering-only scenario, Microsoft Defender for Office 365 provides cloud-based email protection for your on-premises Exchange Server environment or any other on-premises SMTP email solution.
-   Microsoft Defender for Office 365 can be enabled to protect Exchange Online cloud-hosted mailboxes.
-   In a hybrid deployment, Microsoft Defender for Office 365 can be configured to protect your messaging environment and control mail routing when you have a mix of on-premises and cloud mailboxes with Exchange Online Protection for inbound email filtering.

# Automate, investigate, and remediate

## Save time with automated investigation and response

When you are investigating a potential cyberattack, time is of the essence. The sooner you identify and mitigate threats, the better off your organization will be. Automated investigation and response (AIR) capabilities include a set of security playbooks that can be launched automatically, such as when an alert is triggered, or manually, such as from a view in Explorer. AIR can save your security operations team time and effort in mitigating threats effectively and efficiently.

[![Air phases](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl/m365-threat-remediate/media/air-phases.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl/m365-threat-remediate/media/air-phases.png#lightbox)

Let's start with a native alert generated by Office 365. These alerts are typically investigated manually today – this is where AIR comes in. Attackers frequently send through benign URLs in emails to bypass notice from security solutions, then they weaponize them after delivery to activate their attack. Notice in the following screenshot that the alert identifies that a URL that was recently weaponized was detected by Microsoft Defender for Office 365 through Safe Links URL detonation (under **Details** on the right-hand side).

[![MS Defender for Office 365 alerts](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl/m365-threat-remediate/media/defender-365-alerts.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl/m365-threat-remediate/media/defender-365-alerts.png#lightbox)

Microsoft Defender for Office 365 triggered an AIR playbook based on this alert and resolved the alert given the auto investigation having completed.

Clicking into the investigation deep link from the alert brings us into the Office 365 Threat Intelligence Summary Investigation Graph. This graph shows all the different entities – emails, users (and their activities), and devices that have been automatically investigated as part of the triggered alert.

[![Office 365 Threat Intelligence Summary Investigation Graph](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl/m365-threat-remediate/media/summary-investigation-graph.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl/m365-threat-remediate/media/summary-investigation-graph.png#lightbox)

Specifically, note that:

-   Several emails (23) that were identified as being relevant to this investigation (based on sender, IP, domain, URL, and other email attributes) and a subset of them (6) were identified as being malicious, sent from an internal user in the organization, which itself is a strong indicator of a compromised user.
-   A user pivot on this investigation also identifies anomalies for one user (Jeff) with respect to a suspicious login and mass downloads of documents.
-   With the compromised user, user anomalies and compromised device threats identified in this investigation, Microsoft Defender for Office 365 has also taken some auto remediations such as blocking the URL, deleting any emails in mailboxes related to this URL, and triggering the AAD workflows for password reset and MFA for the compromised user. The ability to take automatic action or drive remediations with manual approval, based on policy, are core elements of AIR.

AIR in Microsoft Defender for Office 365 includes certain remediation actions. Whenever an automated investigation is running or has completed, you'll typically see one or more remediation actions that require approval by your security operations team to proceed. Such remediation actions include the following:

-   Soft delete email messages or clusters
-   Block URL (time-of-click)
-   Turn off external mail forwarding
-   Turn off delegation

These actions can be found in the **Actions** tab under the selected investigation, as shown in the following screenshot:

[![Actions found under Action tab](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl/m365-threat-remediate/media/actions-tab.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl/m365-threat-remediate/media/actions-tab.png#lightbox)

# Configure, protect, and detect

With Microsoft Defender for Office 365, your organization's security team can configure protection by defining policies in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal. The policies that are defined for your organization determine the behavior and protection level for predefined threats. Policy options are flexible. For example, your organization's security team can set fine-grained threat protection at the user, organization, recipient, and domain level. It is important to review your policies regularly because new threats and challenges emerge daily.

## Safe Attachments

Microsoft Defender for Office 365 Safe Attachments protects against unknown malware and viruses, and provides zero-day protection to safeguard your messaging system. All messages and attachments that don't have a known virus/malware signature are routed to a special environment where Microsoft Defender for Office 365 uses a variety of machine learning and analysis techniques to detect malicious intent. If no suspicious activity is detected, the message is released for delivery to the mailbox.

When creating a Safe Attachments policy, the following options can be selected:

-   Under the **Action for unknown malware** in Attachments:
    -   **Off**. Attachments will not be scanned for malware.
    -   **Monitor**. Continues delivering the message after malware is detected and track the scanning results.
    -   **Block**. Blocks the current and future emails and attachments with detected malware.
    -   **Replace**. Blocks the attachments with detected malware but continues to deliver the message body to the user.
    -   **Dynamic delivery**. Immediately delivers the message body without attachments and reattaches attachments after scanning if they are found to be safe.
-   Under **Redirect attachment on detection** you have the ability to enable one or both of the following settings:
    -   If you want to forward attachments that are blocked, replaced, or monitored to a security administrator in your organization for further investigation, check the **Enable redirect** checkbox and enter an email address.
    -   You can also have those attachments forwarded if the scanning process should time out by selecting the **Apply the above selection if malware scanning for attachments times out or error occurs** checkbox.

[![New Safe Attachments policy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl/m365-threat-remediate/media/new-safe-attachments-policy.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl/m365-threat-remediate/media/new-safe-attachments-policy.png#lightbox)

Once you've configured these settings, you can target users with that policy by specific domain, username, or group membership (or a combination). There are also exceptions that can be configured for this targeting, by users, groups, or domain.

[![Safe Attachment policy applied](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl/m365-threat-remediate/media/policy-applied.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl/m365-threat-remediate/media/policy-applied.png#lightbox)

Sometimes it is useful to allow mail to flow without delay from internal senders such as scans or faxes that send attachments that are known to be safe and from a trusted source. It is not generally recommended to skip filtering for all internal messages as a compromised account would be able to potentially send malicious content. You can create a transport rule, also known as a mail flow rule, in the Exchange admin center (EAC) to bypass safe attachments scanning. As part of the mail flow rule, modify the message properties to set a message header with the **X-MS-Exchange-Organization-SkipSafeAttachmentProcessing** as the header name to bypass the safe attachment policy.

## Safe Links

The Microsoft Defender for Office 365 Safe Links feature proactively protects your users from malicious URLs in a message or in an Office document. The protection remains every time they select the link, as malicious links are dynamically blocked while good links can be accessed.

Safe Links is available for URLs in the following apps:

-   Microsoft 365 apps for enterprise on Windows or Mac
-   Office for the web (Word for the web, Excel for the web, PowerPoint for the web, and OneNote for the web)
-   Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Visio on Windows, as well as Office apps on iOS and Android devices
-   Microsoft Teams channels and chats

Safe links is both client and location agnostic, in that the location and device being used by the end user will not affect the behavior of wrapped links. Additionally, Safe links can be configured to support links in Office 2016 clients where the user is signed in with their Office 365 credential.

Safe links includes a default policy that controls global settings such as which links to block and which links to wrap. You can't delete this policy, but you can edit it in your environment as needed, such as blocking a malicious link specific to your environment. It is recommended that you apply Microsoft Defender for Office 365 safe links policies to ALL users in your organization.

The following options can be configured as part of the Safe Links policy:

-   For **Select the action for unknown potentially malicious URLs in messages**, selecting **On** will allow URLs to be rewritten and checked.
-   **Use Safe Attachments to scan downloadable content** will enable URL detection to scan files hosted on web sites. For example, if an email contains a link such as `https://contoso.com/maliciousfile.pdf`, the .pdf file is opened in a separate hypervisor environment and, if the file is found to be malicious, users will see a warning page if they click the link.
-   **Apply safe links to messages sent within the organization** will provide the same level of protection when links are sent by email within the organization.
-   **Do not track when users click safe links** enables or disables storing Safe Links click data for clicked URLs. Microsoft recommends leaving this setting unselected, which enables tracking for clicked URLs.
-   **Do not allow users to click through to the original URL** will prevent users from proceeding to the target web site if it is found to be malicious.
-   If users frequently receive links from web sites that are known to be safe, you can enter those URLs under **Do not rewrite the following URL**. For example, you might add the URL to a partner's website if users frequently receive emails from the partner that include URLs to the external organization's website.

[![New Safe Links policy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl/m365-threat-remediate/media/new-safe-links-policy.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl/m365-threat-remediate/media/new-safe-links-policy.png#lightbox)

Similar to bypassing safe attachments, you can also create a transport rule to bypass safe links. The message header for bypassing safe links is **X-MS-Exchange-Organization-SkipSafeLinksProcessing**.

## Anti-phishing policies

Microsoft Defender for Office 365 anti-phishing checks incoming messages for indicators that a message might be a phishing attempt. When users are covered by Microsoft Defender for Office 365 policies (Safe Attachments, Safe Links, or anti-phishing), incoming messages are evaluated by multiple machine learning models that analyze messages. The appropriate action is taken, based on the configured policies.

There is no default Microsoft Defender for Office 365 anti-phishing policy. When creating one, only targeting is originally configured. Impersonation settings play a large role in Microsoft Defender for Office 365 anti-phishing policies. Impersonation is where the sender or the sender's email domain in a message looks very similar to a real sender or domain:

-   An example impersonation of the domain contoso.com is ćóntoso.com.
-   An example impersonation of the user michelle@contoso.com is michele@contoso.com.

An impersonated domain might otherwise be considered legitimate (registered domain, configured email authentication records, etc.), except its intent is to deceive recipients. In the Microsoft Defender for Office 365 anti-phishing policy, you can configure a set of users to protect, domains to protect, actions for protected users (such as redirect messages or sending to junk folders), safety tips, trusted senders, and domains and more. These settings are exclusive to Microsoft Defender for Office 365 anti-phishing. Anti-spoofing settings are also included in Microsoft Defender for Office 365 anti-phishing policies.

# Simulate attacks

![Technological shifts for defenders.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl/m365-threat-remediate/media/defender-shift.png)

Microsoft Defender for Office 365 includes best-of-class threat investigation and response tools that enable your organization's security team to anticipate, understand, and prevent malicious attacks.

-   **Threat trackers** provide the latest intelligence on prevailing cybersecurity issues. For example, you can view information about the latest malware, and take countermeasures before it becomes an actual threat to your organization. Available trackers include Noteworthy trackers, Trending trackers, Tracked queries, and Saved queries.
-   **Threat Explorer** (or real-time detections) (also referred to as Explorer) is a real-time report that allows you to identify and analyze recent threats. You can configure Explorer to show data for custom periods.
-   **Attack Simulator** allows you to run realistic attack scenarios in your organization to identify vulnerabilities. Simulations of current types of attacks are available, including spear phishing, credential harvest and attachment attacks, and password spray and brute force password attacks.

Threat Explorer enables you to begin delving into granular data for your organization. Inside Threat Explorer, you are first shown the variety of threat families impacting our organization over time. Additionally, you are shown the top threats and top targeted users inside the organization.

You can also change the category for the graph. In this case, the malware family is shown, but you can filter the Threat Explorer graph through several options including sender email, recipient email, and even the detection technology used to stop a threat. The detection technology piece highlights the issue if an email was blocked by Microsoft Defender for Cloud's sandboxing or through an EOP filter. The graph adjusts to reflect the category being examined.

[![Threat Explorer graph](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl/m365-threat-remediate/media/threat-explorer-graph.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl/m365-threat-remediate/media/threat-explorer-graph.png#lightbox)

Threat Explorer allows a deeper look into a threat, beginning with a thorough description of this malware family's behavior. Threat Explorer provides a definition of the threat, the message traces of emails delivering the threat, technical details of the threat, global details of the threat, and advanced analysis.

On the **Users** tab, you can see each instance that a user in the organization was sent an attachment containing the Nemucod malware threat. You can not only see the specific recipients and subject, but the sender domain and the sender IP as well. The **Status** column tells you if the email was caught and blocked before it ever reached the user, or if it was delivered as spam.

[![Malware family description](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl/m365-threat-remediate/media/malware-family-description.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl/m365-threat-remediate/media/malware-family-description.png#lightbox)

If a user had actually received and opened the email, that would also appear under **Status**, enabling you to reach out to the user and take the appropriate remediation steps, such as scanning their device.
