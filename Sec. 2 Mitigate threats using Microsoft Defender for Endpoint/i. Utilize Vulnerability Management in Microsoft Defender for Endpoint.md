# Introduction

Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management discovers vulnerable and misconfigured devices based on known attack vectors and software vulnerabilities.

You're a Security Operations Analyst working at a company that has implemented Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. You're responsible for working with the endpoint management team to remediate weaknesses reported by Vulnerability Management.

A new threat is listed in the Threat Analytics dashboard. You can quickly see that none of your devices are vulnerable to this new threat because Vulnerability Management has already provided the analysis required on your devices.

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

-   Describe Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management
-   Identify vulnerabilities on your devices
-   Track emerging threats

Effectively identifying, assessing, and remediating endpoint weaknesses is pivotal in running a healthy security program and reducing organizational risk. Vulnerability management serves as an infrastructure for reducing organizational exposure, hardening endpoint surface area, and increasing organizational resilience.

Discover vulnerabilities and misconfigurations in real time with sensors and without the need for agents or periodic scans. It prioritizes vulnerabilities based on the threat landscape, detections in your organization, sensitive information on vulnerable devices, and business context.

## Bridging the workflow gaps

Vulnerability management is built in, in real time, and cloud-powered. It's fully integrated with the Microsoft endpoint security stack, the Microsoft Intelligent Security Graph, and the application analytics knowledge base.

Vulnerability management is the industry's first solution to bridge the gap between security administration and IT administration during the remediation process. Create a security task or ticket by integrating with Microsoft Intune and Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager.

## Real-time discovery

To discover endpoint vulnerabilities and misconfiguration, vulnerability management uses the same agentless built-in Defender for Endpoint sensors to reduce cumbersome network scans and IT overhead.

It also provides:

-   Real-time device inventory - Devices onboarded to Defender for Endpoint automatically report and push vulnerability and security configuration data to the dashboard.
    
-   Visibility into software and vulnerabilities - Optics into the organization's software inventory and software changes like installations, uninstalls, and patches. Newly discovered vulnerabilities are reported with actionable mitigation recommendations for 1st and 3rd party applications.
    
-   Application runtime context - Visibility on application usage patterns for better prioritization and decision-making.
    
-   Configuration posture - Visibility into organizational security configuration or misconfigurations. Issues are reported in the dashboard with actionable security recommendations.
    

## Intelligence-driven prioritization

Vulnerability management helps customers prioritize and focus on the weaknesses that pose the most urgent and the highest risk to the organization. It fuses security recommendations with dynamic threat and business context:

-   Exposing emerging attacks in the wild - Dynamically aligns the prioritization of security recommendations. Vulnerability management focuses on vulnerabilities currently being exploited in the wild and emerging threats that pose the highest risk.
    
-   Pinpointing active breaches - Correlates vulnerability management and EDR insights to prioritize vulnerabilities being exploited in an active breach within the organization.
    
-   Protecting high-value assets - Identify the exposed devices with business-critical applications, confidential data, or high-value users.
    

## Seamless remediation

Vulnerability management allows security administrators and IT administrators to collaborate seamlessly to remediate issues.

-   Remediation requests sent to IT - Create a remediation task in Microsoft Intune from a specific security recommendation. We plan to expand this capability to other IT security management platforms.
    
-   Alternate mitigations - Gain insights on more mitigations, such as configuration changes that can reduce the risk associated with software vulnerabilities.
    
-   Real-time remediation status - Real-time monitoring of the status and progress of remediation activities across the organization.

## Vulnerability Management area

The following areas are visible in the Vulnerability Management area of the Microsoft 365 Defender portal:

### Dashboard

The Dashboard provides multiple tiles showing your overall exposure and remediation information.

### Recommendations

The Recommendations page provides a list of security recommendations.

### Inventories

The Inventories page opens with a list of software installed in your network, including the vendor name, weaknesses found, threats associated with them, exposed devices, impact to exposure score, and tags. You can filter the list view based on weaknesses found in the software, threats associated with them, and tags like whether the software has reached end-of-support.

### Weaknesses

The Weaknesses page lists the software vulnerabilities your devices are exposed to by listing the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID. You can also view the severity, Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) rating, prevalence in your organization, corresponding breach, threat insights, and more.

### Event timeline

The Event timeline is a risk news feed that helps you interpret how risk is introduced into the organization through new vulnerabilities or exploits. You can view events that may impact your organization's risk. For example, you can find new vulnerabilities that were introduced, vulnerabilities that became exploitable, exploits that were added to an exploit kit, and more. Event timeline also tells the story of your exposure score and Microsoft Secure Score for Devices so you can determine the cause of large changes. Events can impact your devices or your score for devices. Reduce your exposure by addressing what needs to be remediated based on the prioritized security recommendations.

### Security Assessments

Instead of running never-ending compliance scans, security baselines assessment helps you to continuously and effortlessly monitor your organization's security baselines compliance and identify changes in real time.

A security baseline profile is a customized profile that you can create to assess and monitor endpoints in your organization against industry security benchmarks. When you create a security baseline profile, you're creating a template that consists of multiple device configuration settings and a base benchmark to compare against.

## Vulnerable devices report

The Reports area in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal has a Vulnerable devices report. The report shows graphs and bar charts with vulnerable device trends and current statistics. The goal is for you to understand the breadth and scope of your device exposure.

The graphs and charts include:

-   **Severity level graphs** - Each device is counted only once according to the most severe vulnerability found on that device.
    
-   **Exploit availability graphs** - Each device is counted only once based on the highest level of known exploit.
    
-   **Vulnerability age graphs** - Each device is counted only once under the oldest vulnerability publication date. Older vulnerabilities have a higher chance of being exploited.
    
-   **Vulnerable devices by operating system platform graphs** - The number of devices on each operating system that are exposed due to software vulnerabilities.
    
-   **Vulnerable devices by Windows version graphs** - The number of devices on each Windows version that are exposed due to vulnerable applications or OS.

# Manage remediation

Vulnerability management capabilities bridges the gap between Security and IT administrators through the remediation request workflow. Security admins like you can request for the IT Administrator to remediate a vulnerability from the Recommendation pages to Intune.

## Remediation request steps

-   Go to the Vulnerability management navigation menu in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal, and select Recommendations.
    
-   Select a security recommendation you would like to request remediation for, and then select Remediation options.
    
-   Fill out the form, including what you are requesting remediation for, applicable device groups, priority, due date, and optional notes. If you choose the "attention required" remediation option, selecting a due date won't be available since there's no specific action.
    
-   Select Submit request. Submitting a remediation request creates a remediation activity item within vulnerability management, which can be used for monitoring the remediation progress for this recommendation. This won't trigger a remediation or apply any changes to devices.
    
-   Notify your IT Administrator about the new request and have them log into Intune to approve or reject the request and start a package deployment.
    
-   Go to the Remediation page to view the status of your remediation request.
    

## View your remediation activities

When you submit a remediation request from the Security recommendations page, it kicks-off a remediation activity. A security task is created that can be tracked on a Remediation page, and a remediation ticket is created in Microsoft Intune.

If you chose the "attention required" remediation option, there will be no progress bar, ticket status, or due date since there's no actual action we can monitor.

Once you are in the Remediation page, select the remediation activity that you want to view. You can follow the remediation steps, track progress, view the related recommendation, export to CSV, or mark as complete.
